# Senior-ML-Project
Overview:
A project me and my teammates made incorporating machine learning algorithms utilizing data preprocessing techniques and primarily convolutional neural networks.

Made by:
Ian Swallow
Ben Harris
Samuel Hobbs
Collins Senaya

Purpose:
Take a large number of .tif files that utilize satelite imagery, and perform analysis on the given data to predict what is being shown in the image. Utilized machine learning concepts to get ~80% accuracy, with room for improvement.
